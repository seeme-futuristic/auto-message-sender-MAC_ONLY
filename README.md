This code is used for send messages to someone using the iMessage app on your Mac device. Use wisely. Message rates may apply.

# Packages you'll need
  - os
  - keyboard
  - time
  
# How to install packages:
  - open terminal
  - create a directory you want the code to be in
  - go to that directory (cd [name of directory])
  - once in the desired directory, in terminal type:
      - pip install os
      - pip install keyboard
      - pip install time ### Note: "time" may be already installed for your python interpreter and will throw an error. If this happens, ignore it and you should be good.
  - done

You should now be able to run the code. You will not need to have the app open before running this code. Also, try not to spam too much ;)
